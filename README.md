# Pacman CTF 

This is the reference code for assignment submission for the Pacman CTF challenge.

This is deliberately not a runnable instance of the game, and likely will be of limited use to anyone coming across this for class assignments as it requires a specific package (lib_piglet) for parsing and solving PDDL, along with the relevant data structures.

This codebase should be used as reference only. Any ideas and code here should be cited (see report_pacman.pdf as an example, I have also referenced other submissions found online hopefully adequately.)
